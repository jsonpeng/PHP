Portus to Commence Pilot with Second Australian Utility
</a></strong></h1>
<p><i>Portus extends advances in Australian Smart Grid market after securing initial small scale pilot and Smart Grid showcase with second Australian utility.</i></p>
<br>
<p> 
<strong><a>Sydney - June 15, 2009 </a></strong>- Building on its early efforts in the Australian Smart Grid market, Portus has today commissioned another Home Area Network (HAN) exhibit in a second utility smart grid showcase, following successful deployment of a similar solution to an initial utility pilot home.Portus' solution increases the efficiency of utility power networks by providing a way to signal to customers the cost associated with each load, thus providing a mechanism to shift consumption. It also educates customers by providing them detailed information on their consumption patterns and CO2 footprints for different appliances over any period of interest.The Portus Home energy management solution will monitor a variety of loads, ranging from the household meter, key electrical circuits in the home including the home air conditioner, lights and a number of household appliances. It also tracks any local generation from installed solar panels. The solution allows the home owner to see the consumption at the meter, each individual circuit, or appliance, separately on a minute by minute basis. The user can also zoom out to view the consumption history at hour, day, week or monthly level. The user can also view an aggregate display showing the contribution of all loads in a single stacked graph, or even view in realtime the instantaneous consumption of each appliance, and also toggle between cost and carbon.</p>
