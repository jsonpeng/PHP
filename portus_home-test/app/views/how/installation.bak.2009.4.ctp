<p>
Your Portus Home system connects directly to your existing broadband modem. You don't need a separate router or wireless access point, because the Portus Home DIAS gateway already integrates that functionality. However, if you wish to retain your existing router, that's fine too. In that case just connect the Portus Home Dias gateway to a free port on your router.

<h2>4. Start using Portus Home</h2>
<div class="stepText">
<p>
As long as you have subscribed to the Portus Home service, your gateway will automatically register with the login portal, allowing you to access your system remotely. You can now start using Portus Home, wherever you are, no  matter whether you are home or away. When you are out of your home, you can connect through your phone or Internet browser. When you are at home, you can also use your phone, wall panel, remote etc to view and control you home.
