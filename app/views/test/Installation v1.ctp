<h2>3. Connect your system</h2>
<p>
	Your Portus Home system connects directly to your existing broadband modem. You don’t need a separate router or wireless access point, because the Portus Home DIAS gateway integrates that functionality. However, if you wish to retain your existing router, that’s fine too. In that case just connect the Portus Home Dias gateway to a free port on your router.
