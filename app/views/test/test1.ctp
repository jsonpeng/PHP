              <p>No. Unlike other solutions on the market, you do not need a separate router or wireless access point. Your Portus Home gateway is a fully integrated wireless broadband gateway, which connects directly to your existing DSL or cable modem. The Portus Home gateway integrates a Wi-Fi access point, router, firewall, and 4 port switch.  You can use your Portus Home gateway for all your home networking requirements. 	</p>
