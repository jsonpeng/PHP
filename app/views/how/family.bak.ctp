Portus Home lets you see what's happening in your home when you're not there. Whether you need to check on your kids at home after school, or just look in on your pets, Portus Home lets you view your home from wherever you are, through either your mobile phone or Internet browser.

Portus Home gives you the same viewpoint when you're home as well. You can use Portus Home from wall-mounted touch panels, your phone, PDA or PC. It lets you see what's happening around your home, while you're home, so you can keep an eye on things while in another room, or even from your garden.

Portus Home also lets you capture live footage, allowing you to record from any of your cameras directly into your secure personal storage area.
