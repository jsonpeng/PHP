PORTUS ANNOUNCES SPECIAL LICENSING PROGRAM FOR EARLY ADOPTERS OF ESSENTIAL REMOTE MONITORING TECHNOLOGY
</a></strong></h1>
<p><i>Limited duration offer of discounted licensing rates to industry</i></p>
<br>
<p> 
<strong><a>Sydney - December 31, 2012 </a></strong>- 
 Portus today announced the introduction of a Special Licensing Program for its Remote Monitoring Patent (AU Patent No. 754,403) entitled, "Local and remote monitoring using a standard web browser".  The Remote Monitoring Patent relates to, among other things, several key technologies underlying remote monitoring and control through a web browser.
 </p>
<p>
The Special Licensing Program is of limited duration (through June 30, 2013) and is being implemented on an industry-wide basis to offer discounted running royalty rates and exceptions to Portus' standard licensing terms and conditions for the '403 Patent.
</p>
<p>
The Special Licensing Program offers licenses at substantial discounts to Portus' standard terms.  However, at the expiration of the Special Licensing Program, Portus will no longer be offering "early adopter" discounted licenses to the Remote Monitoring Patent and will only offer licenses at its standard royalty rates, which are substantially higher than its Special Licensing Program rates.
</p>
<p>
"It's been our intention to work with the industry to simplify licensing of this critical technology", said Tim Lindquist, Portus CEO. "We have always been committed to an industry wide licensing program that promotes, rather than inhibits, the growth of web based remote monitoring and control", continued Mr. Lindquist.  "To accommodate the industry, we will continue to offer discounted licenses through June 30.  After that, we will only offer licenses on our standard terms and conditions which will be substantially higher".
