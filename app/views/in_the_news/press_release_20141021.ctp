<p><i>Portus Bringing Australian Cleantech Companies to Wuhan China.</i></p>
<br>
<p> 
<strong><a>Sydney - October 21, 2014 </a></strong>- 
Portus is inviting a VIP delegation of leading Australian Cleantech companies to China for a VIP Delegation Tour from November 10 - 17. The tour is focused on Wuhan, with secondary events in Hangzhou and Jinhua. In the next five years the Wuhan government is spending the equivalent of Â£200 billion on redeveloping the city, which is more than double what the UK will spend for the entire country. Key events include CBEC 2014, the Cross Border E-commerce Forum in Wuhan and the Hangzhou International Cross Border E-commerce and Service Outsourcing Cooperation Summit.

Portus is pursuing an Intelligent Energy vision that revolves around intelligence in the home that manages all residential demand response potential and storage capacity, such as that embodied in electric vehicles, in a holistic manner. Portus also promoted an intelligent integrated management approach to diverse demand response and storage capacity resources available at the residential level. By taking such an approach, Portus' solution can respond to the demands of intermittent renewables, by managing  electric vehicle charging to occur at times of increased wind or solar generation, or by providing demand response at times of insufficient supply. Careful management of these processes will allow Portus to deliver firmness of response, and also to respond to caps on upstream assets, such as distribution transformers and feeders. Ultimately, Portus technology can deliver more capacity to the grid when needed, and enable greater penetration of intermittent renewables onto the grid.
